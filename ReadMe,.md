# Italian Greetings Website

This is a simple website to help you learn basic Italian greetings. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website looks good on computers, tablets, and phones.
- **Navigation:** Easily switch between pages for greetings, places, and verbs.
- **Word Cards:** Italian greetings are shown as cards. Click a card to see more details.
- **Modal Popup:** When you click a word card, a popup (modal) appears showing the word, its meaning, and a related image.
- **Lazy Loading Images:** Images in the modal load only when needed, making the site faster.

## How It Works

- The main page (`index.html`) displays Italian greeting words.
- The words are stored in a JavaScript array and shown as cards.
- When you click a card, a modal appears with more information and a picture.
- The CSS (`styles.css`) makes the site look nice and ensures it works well on all devices.
- The JavaScript (`js/script.js`) handles showing the words and the modal popup.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click on any greeting card to learn more about it.
3. Use the navigation links to explore other sections (Places, Verbs).

## Folder Structure



## Customization

- You can add more Italian words by editing the `words` array in `index.html`.
- To make the site even faster, use smaller or optimized images.
